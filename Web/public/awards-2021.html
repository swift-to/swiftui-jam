<h1 id="toc_0">The SwiftUI Jam Awards</h1>

<p>Welcome one and all to the SwiftUI Jam Awards. For those of you joining us who might not be familiar with what SwiftUI Jam is, it is a 54-hour code-a-thon that we ran for our community February 19th-21st. It was an incredible journey watching our participants bring their ideas to light over such a small period of time. Our timeline was filled throughout the weekend with pictures, gifs and videos of incredible progress made by so many teams. You can still see a lot of it today by searching #swiftuijam on Twitter.
We are so grateful for the vibrant community of participants that came together and set aside a weekend to jam with us.</p>

<p>We could go on and on with the praise we have for our community but what you are really here for today are the awards. As you may already know, we encouraged all our participants to open source their work in order to be considered for awards. While we see this event as completely non-competitive we wanted to find a way to still encourage open sourcing work and diversity of submissions.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Submissions/Non-submissions</h3>

<p>Speaking of encouragement, we just wanted to acknowledge that whether or not you submitted your work at the end of this jam, that you did a great job. Finishing a code jam is really hard and takes practice. It is an art in and of itself. A code jam is also a great place to make mistakes, try wild ideas, practice your team collaboration and scoping skills. A code jam is as much about the journey as the destination. So we hope you take us seriously when we say that you are all winners for participating in this event.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Judgement considerations</h3>

<p>Before we get to the awards we wanted to make a few things clear that helped guide our decision making when picking an award winner got tough. First, we awarded a maximum of 1 award per team. Some apps may have been nominees for multiple categories but we tried to pick one where they were strongest. Secondly, when in doubt, we favored submission completeness. If two apps were strong in one category but one was more end-to-end complete we gave it the benefit.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Awards</h2>

<h3 id="toc_4">Little Code, Big Impact - Shimmer by Josh Homann</h3>

<p>Our first award honors a contribution that is not all about code quantity. Shimmer is a Swift Package for adding a shimmer effect to redacted SwiftUI Views to make loading skeletons. If you look at the code that makes this happen, the main file is less than 100 lines. Nonetheless it delivers something incredibly useful that is a very common request from design teams these days. Josh has done an incredible good job of laying out examples and even documenting the works in a blog entry. Outstanding work, Josh. We hope we’ll see Shimmer listed on the Swift Package Index soon.
Awesome Animations Award - Quiz Me Up! by Pandemic Wenches</p>

<p>Our jam had a lot of great submissions with slick animations but we were particularly floored by the look and feel of every part of Quiz Me Up! No transition went without receiving love from the team and it filled a simple quiz app full of energy. Definitely check this one out.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Good Game Award - ShiftUI by ShiftUI</h3>

<p>Our Game Award was another category full of cool submissions which made this tough. ShiftUI did a great job of playing with neumorphic design elements and implementing a classic puzzle game mechanism. The swipe interactions on this game felt really good and we were particularly impressed that you could shift entire rows and columns at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Deep Docs - HelloSwift by Praxxis Labs</h3>

<p>Our deep docs award was a tricky one to award specifically from a code documentation perspective because we realized that clean well documented code and codeathons are not necessarily a great match for one another. However, we felt that the Praxxis Labs team embodied the concept of documentation in everything they did. The app itself is a concept for an interactive tool that teaches swiftui. It contains many simple swiftui apps that each can be inspected on a view for view basis to see the underlying code. In addition to this the team also did an audio blog every day documenting their journey.</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">UI Elementalist - iRetro by JustUs</h3>

<p>We were really impressed with the iRetro’s throwback to an older era of that tiny brick in your pocket that could hold every song you ever owned. Not only does it look cool, it functions too. You can install this app on your phone and immediately start playing music from your Apple Music library. The touch dial is functional, they implemented both a light and dark themed version of the iPod, they even added haptics and sound effects too, which gives the experience a very wholesome feel. You can even be already listening to the Music app, open iRetro and see it in the ‘Now Playing’ section.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">Brilliant Blog Award - Quiz Jam by Women Who Code</h3>

<p>The Quiz Jam app is a nice little flash card application, complete with Tinder-like swipe interactions, card flips and a score meter. You can add your own flash cards in the manage section which makes good use of the edit functionalities available in SwiftUI. Not only did the team deliver a thorough and complete app, they also wrote a great blog post about the app, how it functions and what SwiftUI gotchas they learned along the way. The members of this team worked across 4 different time zones and at varying skill levels, yet managed to deliver a 100% complete concept - no partial features delivered. This is a testament to their planning and collaboration skills which they discuss a bit in the blog as well. We liked that this blog not only tackled what they learned while coding, but how they planned to execute effectively in a short period of time.</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">Wild Wild Widget - Unit Quest by Flappy Octopus</h3>

<p>Widgets were another category with many good submissions. What we liked most about Unit Quest was that it was both an iOS app and a widget that functioned well together. The basic concept of the app is to gamify your todo list by assigning tasks to RPG units that level up over time as you get stuff done. For every unit you can add a separate widget for tracking their progress. We also liked that when you tapped the widget it took you to the relevant unit’s detail page, demonstrating some nice cross-communication between the widgets and the app.</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">Comedian Award - Noise Time by Moonshot</h3>

<p>We threw the comedian award to team Moonshot for their simple, yet effective and amusing sound board watch app. Noise Time is a soundboard of goofy sound clips from the TV show Adventure Time. If you’re looking for a goofy app for your watch that plays Adventure Time sound clips, or maybe you wanted to repurpose it to play your own set of sounds, check this app out.</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">Platform Pro - Whensday by Singleton</h3>

<p>Whensday is an todo list application complete with date management and priority flagging capabilities. What we really liked about this app was how different it looked on iOS versus MacOS. A lot of attention was paid to making each interface fit the platform well. We think this is a great codebase to look into for inspiration on how you might want to set up an app to hit both platforms.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">Swift Package Master - Waveform by Just Doug</h3>

<p>While we didn’t list this award on the website, it occurred to us that it was one worth recognizing. We had a couple of submissions that were developed into Swift Packages. Both Shimmer, the winner of our Little Code, Big Impact Award and Waveform by Doug. Waveform is an impressive library for displaying audio wave forms, including pinch and zoom capabilities and segment selection. There is an impressive number of capabilities for audio waveform interaction in this application. </p>

<h3 id="toc_13">Honorable Mentions</h3>

<p>Before we close we also wanted to take some time to acknowledge a few other apps we thought were neat</p>

<h3 id="toc_14">Specto by Team Shamoushack</h3>

<p>We want to commend this team because they’ve been continuing to work on their project in a separate branch, and it is definitely worth checking out the latest code to see everything in its full glory. The Specto app is quite impressive. It allows you to record audio messages, while simulating the waveform being copied on to a vinyl disc and maintained in a collection. They even made a watch extension.</p>

<h3 id="toc_15">Some cool widgets - Bikeshare, BookMyVaccine and HealthJam</h3>

<p>As we mentioned before, there were some really neat widget applications and we wanted to acknowledge a few quickly.
Bikeshare is a widget for seeing bikes available for rent near your current location. Book My Vaccine came with a few apps for graphing how vaccination was progressing in a country of your choosing.
HeathJam is a nice looking little widget for getting a few more exercise metrics that you won&#39;t see on your watch rings.</p>

<h3 id="toc_16">Other games - Hex and PuzzleMania</h3>

<p>We really liked the grid implementation in the Hex app. It was neat to see how they laid the hexagon grid out in the code. PuzzleMania was also quite well done. It allows you to pick any photo from your library, dice it up into segments and then reassemble it from the shuffled pieces.</p>

<h2 id="toc_17">Gallery Now Open</h2>

<p>There’s still so much we haven’t had the chance to talk about today, so we encourage you to head over to the SwiftUI Jam gallery and see all the submissions in their glory. For team captains who want to further edit their information, submission editing is now available again. We’ve also added a new data column to allow you to provide a link to the latest code, should you be interested in showcasing your most up to date work and not just what was completed by the end of the jam.</p>
